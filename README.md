# Final Project of zero to pandas course by Aakash NS


 # Title - Job Details Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the final project for the "Zero To Pandas" course, where I analyzed a dataset related to job details. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle and includes historical data on major job details. It contains information such as work year, job title, salary details, employee residence, and more.

## Data Cleaning

To ensure the quality of the analysis, I performed data cleaning steps, including handling missing or incorrect values and making necessary adjustments to the dataset. This ensures that the data is suitable for meaningful analysis.

## Exploratory Analysis

The exploratory analysis involves examining the distribution of salaries, job categories, experience levels, employment types, and company sizes. Visualization techniques such as histograms, bar plots, line plots, and box plots were utilized to gain insights into the dataset.

## Asking and Answering Questions

Several questions were posed and answered using the dataset, such as average salary by job category, distribution of experience levels, and average salary by experience level. These questions were addressed through visualizations for better understanding.

## File Structure

- `Zero_To_Pandas_Final_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis.
- `jobs_in_data.csv (1).zip`: Dataset used for analysis.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed by running `!pip install jovian opendatasets --upgrade --quiet` in your Python environment.
2. Load the Jupyter Notebook `Zero_To_Pandas_Final_Project.ipynb` to review the analysis steps and visualizations.
3. The dataset (`jobs_in_data.csv (1).zip`) can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) for further exploration.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like additional details on the analysis.
